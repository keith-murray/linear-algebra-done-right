\section{Purpose}
There are many interpretations of mathematics, but I prefer the interpretation of math as a language. Learning a language involves reading, so it follows that you should read your textbooks, but it also involves conversing and writing, so you should talk with others about the math you learn and attempt to solve exercises included in your textbook.

I'm writing the solutions to \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right} mainly as an exercise in my ability to write math, but also as a resource for others to read math. Perhaps by providing these solutions I am depriving the reader of the opportunity to write math, and thus, the opportunity to learn math. But in the age of the internet, solutions to math problems are easy to come by. If the reader is intent on learning math, then they must exercise the fortitude necessary to prevent themselves from looking at these solutions. But once they have their own solutions, sources like these provide an invaluable resource to assess if they came to the correct solution.

Languages are tools for conversation. In effect, these solutions are one-half of that conversation.
